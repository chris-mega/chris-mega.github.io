We had more challenges this year with the hardware side, which made me learn a lot in just a few days. There were more teams and everybody improved comparing to last year, which made the competition very hard. Teamwork and leadership was something that I definitely practiced this year because we moved to a shared platform. Learned more about the Robotis-Op3 Framework and how to adapt it to the lab\u0026rsquo;s purpose, which meant that two different robots could use the same code. Also improved in OpenCV, Python and ROS.\nQualification video\nUManitoba press\n","date":1566882000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566882000,"objectID":"1f6f34c024639916c6dcd33143f358b7","permalink":"https://chris-mega.github.io/project/fira2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/fira2019/","section":"project","summary":"Participation with team Snobots for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2019 in South Korea.","tags":["Robotics","Sports"],"title":"Fira 2019","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Participation with team Snobots-Kid for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2018 at Taichung, Taiwan.\nWe programmed a robot to compete in diverse sports at FIRA Hurocup 2018.

I got to practice and learn more about C++, learn OpenCV and a brand new way to code using ROS and Robotis-OP3 Framework. I also made friends with my colleagues and other competitors from different countries. Teamwork, think outside the box and persistence made our first time competing a good experience with a good positioning among more than 10 teams.\nQualification video\nLab\u0026rsquo;s website\n","date":1535346000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535346000,"objectID":"a87e10fc0055be2ab11d12e26ef5b33c","permalink":"https://chris-mega.github.io/project/fira2018/","publishdate":"2018-08-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/fira2018/","section":"project","summary":"Participation with team Snobots for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2018 in Taiwan.","tags":["Robotics","Sports"],"title":"Fira 2018","type":"project"}]
