I learned a lot this year. There were more teams and everybody improved comparing to last year, which made the competition harder. Teamwork and leadership were the skills that I definitely practiced this year. The principal challenge was the hardware side, in robotics your code may work, but there are more variables that may make tour program succesful or not like camera calibration, surface roughness, servos and expected target sizes. Also practiced how to change a servo in 10 minutes under pressure üòÅ\nWe moved to a shared platform, which meant to handle two different robots using the same code and framework (Robotis-Op3-Framework in ROS). I was involved in the design of the architecture and tasks to reach our goals, in addition to the programming of some of the events.\nAlso improved in OpenCV, Python and ROS.\n\rQualification video\n\rUManitoba press\nPart of the Team: Marshall Jackson, Borui Li, Yanlam Ng, Dr. Meng Cheng Lau, Chris Melendez (me), Louis O\u0026rsquo;Connor, Andy Lun\n","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"a6958171959dc915007e03f7fb39828f","permalink":"/competition/fira2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competition/fira2019/","section":"competition","summary":"Participation with team Snobots for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2019 in South Korea","tags":["Robotics","Sports"],"title":"FIRA 2019","type":"competition"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556064000,"objectID":"36e3065fa43d276048686a0fe75a7dd3","permalink":"/project/fabrik/","publishdate":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fabrik/","section":"project","summary":"A final project for my Computer Graphics course that explored \"Forward and Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics\" in OpenGL.","tags":["Computer Graphics, Research"],"title":"FABRIK","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1542931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542931200,"objectID":"c9136fc733a547c272287fa80a2cbce0","permalink":"/project/split-it/","publishdate":"2018-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/split-it/","section":"project","summary":"A group project for Human Computer Interaction course for splitting bills in different ways.","tags":["WebDev, HCI"],"title":"SplitIt","type":"project"},{"authors":["Christian Melendez-Gallegos"],"categories":null,"content":"Participation with team Snobots-Kid for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2018 at Taichung, Taiwan.\nWe programmed a robot to compete in diverse sports at FIRA Hurocup 2018.

I got to practice and learn more about C++, learn OpenCV and a brand new way to code for me using ROS and Robotis-OP3 Framework (which uses publishers and subscribers). Also learned how a humanoid robot works: vision and motion planning. I also made friends with my colleagues and other competitors from different countries. Teamwork, thinking outside the box, reverse engineering and persistence made our first time competing a good experience with a good positioning among more than 10 teams.\n\rQualification video\n\rLab\u0026rsquo;s website\nPart of the Team: Chris Melendez (me), Mario Mendez, Jackie Baltes (organizer), Dr. Meng Cheng Lau, Louis O\u0026rsquo;Connor, Borui Li\n","date":1535328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535328000,"objectID":"7550607339ffc0fbcb7d80b074c574d2","permalink":"/competition/fira2018/","publishdate":"2018-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competition/fira2018/","section":"competition","summary":"Participation with team Snobots for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2018 in Taiwan.","tags":["Robotics","Sports"],"title":"FIRA 2018","type":"competition"}]
