We had more challenges this year with the hardware side, which made me learn a lot in just a few days. There were more teams and everybody improved comparing to last year, which made the competition very hard. Teamwork and leadership was something that I definitely practiced this year because we moved to a shared platform. Learned more about the Robotis-Op3 Framework and how to adapt it to the lab\u0026rsquo;s purpose, which meant that two different robots could use the same code. Also improved in OpenCV, Python and ROS.\n Qualification video\n UManitoba press\n","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"a6958171959dc915007e03f7fb39828f","permalink":"/competition/fira2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competition/fira2019/","section":"competition","summary":"Participation with team Snobots for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2019 in South Korea","tags":["Robotics","Sports"],"title":"FIRA 2019","type":"competition"},{"authors":["Christian Melendez-Gallegos"],"categories":null,"content":"Participation with team Snobots-Kid for University of Manitoba in FIRA 2018 at Taichung, Taiwan.\nWe programmed a robot to compete in diverse sports at FIRA Hurocup 2018.
